			<li>Topic Aware Hate Diffusion on Twitter (PhD Student, LCS2):<br>
Worked on a modelling hate speech genesis and diffusion over Twitter, combining signals from the user's profile, and external influences. Performed a detailed comparison of the proposed approach against a suit of baselines. Conducted ablation study on various hate signals, and hyper-parameter tuning. Contributed to data collection and literature review. (Paper under review for ICDE 2021).<br>

		<ul style="list-style-type: none">
			<li>Worked on an analytics project to help developers with better toolings. The work included data collection, cleaning, and modelling using a graph-based approach. We used various techniques in recommendation systems to improve developer analytics. I have contributed to the work in Graph Databases, License Conflict Resolution, Package Recommendations using Probabilistic Graphical Models, and Matrix Factorization.<br>
Initially as an intern, I completed PoCs for License and CVE analysis for NPM data, implemented baseline code for data entity-models for ingestion into graph DB.<br>
In addition, I contributed to data engineering and testing jobs for the project. Fixing issues across the analytics platform's backend. When I got an opportunity, I represented the product at meetups and conferences.<br> <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.fabric8-analytics">See Project</a>
